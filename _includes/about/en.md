> **I'm Moonming**

"When a person is 30 years old, he should know himself well, know exactly what his strengths and weaknesses are, know where his limits are, and foresee his own declineâ€”being himself. Especially accepting these. We will become very positive. Everything needs to be practiced, and everything needs to be thrown away. No more pretentious, but still wearing a mask.

I have seen enough of the world, I can almost put everything aside. The rest is a continuous and incredible effort every day. Efforts to keep secrets without hope or complaint. Never deny anything, because everything can be affirmed. Overcome the scar. "
